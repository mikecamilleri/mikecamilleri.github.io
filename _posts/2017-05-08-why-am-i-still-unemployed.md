I've [written about my job search before](http://mikecamilleri.com/blog/on-my-job-search/). At that time I had been unemployed for seven months. I have now been unemployed for almost ten months, ðŸ˜ž. At this point I think that employers may look at how long I have been unemployed and wonder, "What's wrong with this guy? Why can't he get a job." In order to to mitigate any such concerns, I feel the need to discuss the reasons here. I've touched on some of these points in my previous post about my job search. 

After a lot of thought and discussion I believe that an unfortunate combination of factors has caused me to remain unemployed for so long. My continued unemployment certainly isn't due to lack of effort -- I spend about forty hours on my job search every week -- nor is it because people don't like me -- when I am fortunate enough to get interviews I am generally well liked and impress the interviewers. In combination, eleven months of experience, a very competitive and volatile job market, and my strong sense of direction create a difficult situation.

## I was laid off with eleven months of experience

Software development is a second career for me. Previously I was a molecular and cellular biologist and a have a master's degree in that field. I earned my second bachelor's degree in computer science from Oregon State University during the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015 -- I completed the program in only one year. I was fortunate to be hired by a startup here in Portland shortly after graduating. I learned a lot and enjoyed my role at that company, but unfortunately I was laid off after only elven months along with five other people. 

I've realized that it is easer to find a job with no professional experience than it is with eleven months of professional experience. I feel that my skills are appropriate for somewhere between junior and mid-level positions. I'd be happy work at the junior-level, but it is very difficult to find those positions. Many companies recruit for those roles at universities, or they hire their interns.

## The job market in Portland is difficult

Several days ago I came across an article entitled ["Oregon tech in the doldrums? Job growth flatlines"](http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2017/05/oregon_tech_in_the_doldrums_jo.html) in the Oregonian. It confirms some of what I've experienced of the last ten months. This sentence says it all: "The industry didn't add any jobs the last 10 months of 2016 amid a sell-off of the state's biggest technology companies and a sharp decline in startup funding." In addition to the number of jobs in the market being low, the market is saturated with candidates. When these companies get acquired, the [cultural changes](http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2017/05/jives_new_owner_says_it_will_m.html) that employees anticipate often cause them to seek roles elsewhere, adding to the number of applicants for the available positions in the market. When I apply for mid-level positions, it's challenging to compete with all of the other candidates who have more experience. 

## I have been unwilling to settle

I have been focusing my job search exclusively on companies that I want to work for and on roles that I am genuinely interested in. I want a position in which I will be able to rapidly grow as a software developer and use modern tools to build modern software that has a genuinely positive impact on the world. It has been suggested to me that I should apply for roles that I'm not really passionate about, and that I should just "take the next offer" and then move on as soon as I can. I am, frankly, unwilling to do that to a company. Hiring, onboarding, and so on takes a lot of time, effort, and money. Companies don't deserve to be mistreated any more than I do as a candidate.

## Some people see what I have to offer

On a few occasions during these ten months, I have come very close to being hired. One position that stands out was at one of the larger companies here in Portland. I am reluctant to go into so much detail that I might reveal which company, but, essentially, it would have been an ideal role for me because in it I would have been able to build upon my existing knowledge and continuously learn while working on an established, but exciting product. After an hour long video conference interview and a four hour in person interview I was told that they would like to make me an offer, but the budget for the position had been moved to another office.

## Something has to change

I am unwilling to settle for a position that I really don't want and, as I discussed above, I don't think that's fair to the company. Something I can change, and want to change, is my job market. I am willing and able to relocate so it makes sense to look for work outside of Portland. I would move most places for the right position, but am focusing heavily on Austin, Texas. Aside from the challenges in my job search, I am excited to try a new part of this country. I intend to spend a week in Austin very soon. 

## Writing software is what I want to do

I am certain that I want to continue pursuing software engineering as a career. I enjoy the entire process of writing software from concept, through design, through implementation, and even debugging. I like that as a software developer I am able to solve a great variety of problems in a great variety of industries and use technology to make the world a better place.
