This is a test post intended to incorporate all of the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) that I may use in blog posts here. Parsed using Kramdown with GFM support.

## Headings (`<h2>`)

The highest level of heading that may be used within a post is `<h2>`. `<h1>` is reserved for the title. 

### Subheadings (`<h3>`)

The lowest level of heading that may be used is `<h3>`. Two levels should be enough for even the most complex blog posts. If more are necessary, the post may be better suited to its own website. 

## Inline Features

**Bold** and _Italic_ text are supported. Although `*` and `_` are interchangeable in Markdown, I always use `**` for **bold** and `_` for _italic_. [Hyperlinks](https://mikecamilleri.com) are supported. Emoji are fun ðŸ¤ª and shouldn't affect line height! I won't demonstrate images here, but the basic syntax is `![alt text](url)`. Backticks (`\``)are used for `code`. `\` can be used to escape \*\*special\*\* characters. 

"Quotes" and apostrophies such as in the word _it's_ should be converted to the so-called "smart" versions--em-dashes should work too!

## Block Features

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes with citations are a mess in both Markdown and HTML. This needs to be worked on. 

Two separate quotes with citations:

> I must die, must I? If at once, then I am dying: if soon, I dine now, as it is time for dinner, and afterwards when the time comes I will die. 
> 
> --Epictetus, _Discourses_

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
> 
> --Steve Jobs

A poem:

> this should be
> on four lines
> like a poem
> fingers crossed

And a multi-paragraph quote with citation:

>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
>
> I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.
>
> --Thoreau, _Walden_

It may be better to just do these using HTML instead of relying on Markdown parsing. Even with plain HTML, there seems to be little concensus on how to handle the citations or even how the `<cite>` tag should be used. `<p class="citation">` might be the best option. 

### Lists

An ordered list:

1. the first thing
2. the second thing
3. the third thing

An unordered list:

- a thing
- b thing
- c thing

### Code Blocks

Code blocks support syntax highlighting. This is in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
