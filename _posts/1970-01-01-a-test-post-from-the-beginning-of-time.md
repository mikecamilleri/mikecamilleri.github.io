This is a test post intended to incorporate all of the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) that I may use in blog posts here. Parsed using Kramdown with GFM support.

## Headings (`<h2>`)

The highest level of heading that may be used within a post is `<h2>`. `<h1>` is reserved for the title. 

### Subheadings (`<h3>`)

The lowest level of heading that may be used is `<h3>`. Two levels should be enough for even the most complex blog posts. If more are necessary, the post may be better suited to its own website. 

## Inline Features

**Bold** and _Italic_ text are supported. Although `*` and `_` are interchangeable in Markdown, I always use `**` for **bold** and `_` for _italic_. [Hyperlinks](https://mikecamilleri.com) are supported. Emoji are fun ðŸ¤ª and shouldn't affect line height! I won't demonstrate images here, but the basic syntax is `![alt text](url)`. Backticks are used for `code`. `\` can be used to escape \*\*special\*\* characters. 

"Quotes" and apostrophies such as in the word _it's_ should be converted to the so-called "smart" versions---em-dashes should work too and require three dashes (`---`).

## Block Features

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes with citations are a mess in both Markdown and HTML. This needs to be worked on. 

A multi-paragraph blockquote with citation:

<figure>
> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
>
> I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.

### Lists

An ordered list:

1. the first thing
2. the second thing
3. the third thing

An unordered list:

- a thing
- b thing
- c thing

### Code Blocks

Code blocks support syntax highlighting. This is in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
