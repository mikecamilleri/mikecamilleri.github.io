I'm a software development engineer with a strong background in the biological sciences who is driven by innovation, good design, and building a better world. Iâ€™m also passionate about philosophy, literature, architecture, and visual art. What ties my diverse interests together are strong desires to both understand the world that we live in and to make that world a better place for all of us.
