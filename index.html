      I’m a software developer who is also passionate about the natural sciences, literature, architecture, and visual art. What ties my interests together are a strong desire to understand the world that we live in and to make that world a better place for all of us.

    <p>
      Lately, I’ve been spending my time working on a few software projects including a text-mode game written in C, an API client for the National Weather Service written in Go, and design work for a general purpose automation platform focused on home automation.

      I’m also actively applying for software engineering jobs located in Portland, Ore. or remote. I'm driven by innovation, good design, and building a better world. I'm especially excited about roles in which I would be able to work with a small team and use modern tools (Golang, Ruby, ...) to build modern software.
