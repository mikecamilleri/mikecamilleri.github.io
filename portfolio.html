<p>Welcome to my portfolio. For now, this portfolio contains mostly coursework from my time in the Computer Science program at Oregon State University. I haven't had time to add everything yet, but it will expand over the next week or so. Each item below links to a GitHub repository with containing code and more documentation. Also check out <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri">my full profile on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri/mikecamilleri.github.io">mikecamilleri.com (mikecamilleri.github.io)</a></dt>
  <dd>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator" written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Fonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-filetransfer">OSU: File Transfer</a></dt>
  <dd>This project consists of two programs which implement a very simple file transfer system for text files. <code>ftserver</code> is written in C and <code>ftclient</code> is written in Python 3. This project demonstrates the use of INET sockets in both C and Python 3. In addition to INET sockets, <code>ftserver</code> makes use of several other important features of C such as file IO, proper memory management (i.e. <code>malloc()</code>, <code>free()</code>), handling user input in a secure way (e.g. <code>strncpy()</code> over <code>strcpy()</code>, and <code>strncat()</code> over <code>strcat()</code>), and the very archaic <code>strtok()</code> function.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-thoughts-api">OSU: Thoughts API</a></dt>
  <dd>The concept is pretty simple. With <em>Thoughts</em>, users can privately store thoughts consisting of strings of 140 characters or less along with a geolocation in the cloud. It is essentially Twitter for yourself. The <em>Thoughts API</em> is mostly RESTful and serves as the backend for a web or mobile app. The API is written in Python to run on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs">Google App Engine</a> and makes use of their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp2">webapp2</a> framework. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/">NDB</a> is used as the noSQL (non-relational) database.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-smallsh">OSU: <code>smallsh</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a simple shell-like program. It demonstrates the use of <code>fork()</code> and <code>exec()</code> to spawn child processes. Other important aspects of the C language demonstrated are safely handling user input and using the archaic (and fun!) <code>strtok()</code> function. Three builtin commands are implemented: <code>cd</code>, <code>status</code>, and <code>exit</code>. Also supported are executing other programs on the system, IO redirection, and child processes.</dd>
