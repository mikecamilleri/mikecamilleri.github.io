Welcome to my portfolio. For now, this portfolio contains mostly coursework from my time in the Computer Science program at Oregon State University. I haven't had time to add everything yet, but it will expand over the next week or so. Each item below links to a GitHub repository with containing code and more documentation. Also check out <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri">my full profile on GitHub</a>.

## [mikecamilleri.com (mikecamilleri.github.io)](https://github.com/mikecamilleri/mikecamilleri.github.io)

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator" written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Fonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing. 

## [OSU: File Transfer](https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-filetransfer)

This project consists of two programs which implement a very simple file transfer system for text files. ‘ftserver’ is written in C and `ftclient` is written in Python 3. This project demonstrates the use of INET sockets in both C and Python 3. In addition to INET sockets, `ftserver` makes use of several other important features of C such as file IO, proper memory management (i.e. `malloc()`, `free()`), handling user input in a secure way (e.g. `strncpy()` over `strcpy()`, and `strncat()` over `strcat()`), and the very archaic `strtok()` function.

## [OSU: Thoughts API](https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-thoughts-api)

The concept is pretty simple. With _Thoughts_, users can privately store thoughts consisting of strings of 140 characters or less along with a geolocation in the cloud. It is essentially Twitter for yourself. The _Thoughts API_ is mostly RESTful and serves as the backend for a web or mobile app. The API is written in Python to run on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) and makes use of their [webapp2](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp2) framework. [NDB](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) is used as the noSQL (non-relational) database.

## [OSU: `smallsh`](https://github.com/mikecamilleri/osu-smallsh)

This is a simple shell-like program. It demonstrates the use of `fork()` and `exec()` to spawn child processes. Other important aspects of the C language demonstrated are safely handling user input and using the archaic (and fun!) `strtok()` function to parse input. Three builtin commands are implemented: `cd`, `status`, and `exit`. The shell also supports executing other programs on the system, IO redirection, and child processes.
