Welcome to my portfolio. For now, most of this portfolio contains mostly coursework from my time in the Computer Science program at Oregon State University. I havn't had time to add everything yet, but it will expand over the next week or so. Each item below links to a GitHub repository with containing code on more documentation. Also check out <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/mikecamilleri">my profile on GitHub</a>.

## [mikecamilleri.com (mikecamilleri.github.io)](https://github.com/mikecamilleri/mikecamilleri.github.io)

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by Jekyll, a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator" written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Webfonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing.
