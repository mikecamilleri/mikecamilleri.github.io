This will be my personal website and include a portfolio and blog. For now, a to do list:

1. Install and configure Ruby dev environment and Jekyll locally.
2. Add Jekyll to repository and configure basic settings.
3. Design templates necessary to generate HTML files.
4. Style with CSS.
5. Add content.
6. Set up analytics (maybe).
