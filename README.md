This will be my personal website and include a portfolio and blog. For now, a to do list:

1. ~~Install and configure Ruby dev environment and Jekyll locally.~~ This was completed previously.
2. ~~Add Jekyll to repository and configure basic settings.~~ Technically, Jekyll wasn't added to the repository, but a default site was using the `jekyll new` command. References: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/ and http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/
3. Design templates necessary to generate HTML files.
4. Style with CSS.
5. Add content.
6. Set up analytics (maybe).
