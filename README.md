This is the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) repository for my personal website at [mikecamilleri.com](http://mikecamilleri.com).

This site is built upon the Jekyll framework because GitHub Pages has [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) support built in. Jekyll is a “simple, blog-aware, static site generator” written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Fonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing.

Below is a to do list outlining some plans for improvement

## To do list:

1. ~~Add back link or breadcrumb trail to the headers of all pages except home.~~
2. ~~Expand the home page text and separate links.~~
3. Refactor HTML and CSS. ~~(Add language attribute to <html> tag).~~
4. ~~Add support for licenses on blog posts (Usually CC BY-SA)~~
5. Add more semantic markup (RDFa, RDFa Lite, or Microdata)
