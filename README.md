This is the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) repository for my personal website at [mikecamilleri.com](http://mikecamilleri.com).

This site is built upon the Jekyll framework because GitHub Pages has [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) support built in. Jekyll is a “simple, blog-aware, static site generator” written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Fonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing.

If you have arrived here from [my portfolio](http://mikecamilleri.com/portfolio/), please take a look at the source code. It’s pretty simplistic (because this is a very simple website), but is an example of front end web development skills as well as working with a basic CMS and using Git in an unusual way.

There are some things that I still want to improve upon or implement, but for now I’m setting my usual perfectionism aside to focus on content. Below is a to do list outlining some plans for improvement

## To do list:

1. Add back link or breadcrumb trail to the headers of all pages except home.
2. Expand the home page text and separate links.
3. Refactor HTML and CSS. (Add language attribute to <html> tag).
4. Add support for licenses on blog posts (Usually CC BY-SA)
5. Add more semantic markup (RDFa, RDFa Lite, or Microdata)
