This is the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) repository for my personal website at [mikecamilleri.com](http://mikecamilleri.com). GitHub Pages has [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) support built in. Jekyll is a “simple, blog-aware, static site generator” written in Ruby. The templates are my own and generate valid HTML5 and CSS (excepting a Google Fonts link and some browser specific CSS). Here I make good use of HTML5 semantics and strive for a design that is as minimal as possible while being navigatable and aesthetically pleasing.

If you have arrived here from [my portfolio](http://mikecamilleri.com/portfolio/), please take a look at the source code. It is pretty simplistic (because this is a very simple website), but is an example of my front end web development skills as well as my ability to work with a basic CMS.

There are some things that I still want to improve upon or implement, but for now I’m setting my usual perfectionism aside to focus on content. Below is a to do list outlining work I’ve done, some notes, and plans for improvement.

A to do list:

1. ~~Install and configure Ruby dev environment and Jekyll locally.~~ This was completed previously.
2. ~~Add Jekyll to repository and configure basic settings.~~ Technically, Jekyll wasn't added to the repository, but a default site was using the `jekyll new` command. References: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/ and http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/
3. ~~Design templates necessary to generate HTML files.~~
4. ~~Style with CSS.~~ Still need to add syntax highlighting. Layout needs some spacing tweaks, especially for smaller devices.
5. ~~Add content.~~ Presently building portfolio. Will blog soon. 
6. Set up analytics (maybe).
